The primary goal of this program is to take the user's income and determine the amount of 
income tax the user would pay under three different tax plans. 

The user will enter an income and then calculate the total taxes owed, the percent of 
gross income paid to taxes, and their net income  for each plan. 

Taxes are Complicated
I am ignoring write-offs, credits, deductions, dependents, and all the other stuff that
make income tax so complex. We will simply calculate taxes for a single taxpayer, 
claiming only him- or herself, taking the standard deduction. The standard deduction is 
currently $5,800 and a single exemption is $3,700. So each income you can assume will 
be $9,500 lower than the entered amount, for tax purposes.
